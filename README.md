# BalanceBendersMath
Coding Project Inspired by the book: Balance Bendersâ„¢ Beginning Logic and Algebraic Reasoning Puzzles.

The books are a collection of puzzles for school kids (mostly elementary and middle) that essentially use balances (weighing scales) and various shapes on the scales. By using this structure, the puzzles can be used to denote equalities and inequalities, the use of variables, writing equations and solving / simplifying equations.
